title: The kernel plugin
---

The kernel plugin refines the generic kbuild plugin to allow building
kernel snaps with all the bells and whistles in one shot...

WARNING: this plugin's API is unstable. The cross compiling support is
         experimental.

The following kernel specific options are provided by this plugin:

    - kernel-image-target:
      (yaml object or string; default: bzImage)
      the default target is bzImage and can be set to any specific
      target.
      For more complex cases where one would want to use
      the same snapcraft.yaml to target multiple architectures a
      yaml object can be used. This yaml object would be a map of
      debian architecture and kernel image build targets.

    - kernel-initrd-modules:
      (array of string)
      list of modules to include in initrd; note that kernel snaps do not
      provide the core boot logic which comes from snappy Ubuntu Core
      OS snap. Include all modules you need for mounting rootfs here.

    - kernel-with-firmware:
      (boolean; default: True)
      use this flag to disable shipping binary firmwares

    - kernel-initrd-firmware:
      (array of string)
      list of firmware files to include in the initrd; these need to be
      relative paths to .installdir and this option does not work if you
      disable building firmware

    - kernel-initrd-compression:
      (string; default: gz)
      initrd compression to use; the only supported value now is 'gz'.

    - kernel-device-trees:
      (array of string)
      list of device trees to build, the format is <device-tree-name>.dts.
