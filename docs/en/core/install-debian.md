title: Install snapd on Debian
---

On Debian snapd is available as part of the testing (currently 'stretch') and unstable ('sid') versions. It is currently not available in any stable version but will be soon.

**Note:** Rasbian is currently not supported due to missing features in the kernel shipped.

Generally you can install snapd on a Debian distribution via:

```
sudo apt install snapd
```

Afterwards everything is setup to get you started with snaps.
