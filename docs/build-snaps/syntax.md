title: The snapcraft syntax
---

The `snapcraft.yaml` file is the main entry point to create a snap through
Snapcraft. The main building blocks are parts and each defined part is
independent from each other. In addition to parts, there are attributes
that define the metadata for the snap package.

What follows is a list of all the attributes the `snapcraft.yaml` file can
contain. They are separated by categories to make this document clearer, but can be declared in any order in the `yaml` file.

### General metadata

The following keys are used to declare the general metadata of your snap: how it will be presented to users, its version, development status and how the Snap Store should consider it (ready for a release in the `stable` channel or not).

* `name` (string)
  The name of the resulting snap.
* `version` (string)
  The version of the resulting snap.
* `summary` (string)
  A 78 character long summary for the snap.
* `description` (string)
  The description for the snap, this can and is expected to be a longer
  explanation for the snap.
* `type` (string)
  The type of snap. Valid values are `app`, `core`, `gadget` and `kernel`. Defaults to `app`.
* `confinement` (string)
  The type of confinement supported by the snap. Can be "strict" , "devmode" or "classic". See [Confinement](/reference/confinement) for details.
* `icon` (string)
  Path to the icon that will be used for the snap.
* `grade` (string)
  This defines the quality grade of the snap. It can be either "devel" (i.e.
  a development version of the snap, so not to be published to the "stable" or
  "candidate" channels) or "stable" (i.e. a stable release or release
  candidate, which can be released to all channels).
* `assumes` (list of strings)
  A list of features that must be supported by the core in order for this snap
  to install.
* `epoch` (string)
  The epoch to which this revision of the snap belongs. This is used to specify
  upgrade paths. For example, `0` is epoch 0; `1*` is the upgrade path from 0 to
  1; `1` is epoch 1, etc.

### Apps and commands

Snaps can ship multiple applications and commands. The following keys allow you to declare them, making them available to users once the snap is installed. The [commands, daemons and assets section](/build-snaps/metadata) contains examples of commands and daemons declarations.

* `apps` (yaml subsection)
  A map of keys for applications names. These are either daemons or command line
  accessible binaries. See [Declaring app commands](/build-snaps/metadata#declaring-app-commands) for examples.
    * `command` (string)
      Specifies the internal command to expose. If it is a `daemon` this
      command is used to start the service.
    * `plugs` (list of strings)
      The list of interfaces the app should have access to. See [Interfaces](/core/interfaces) for details on plugs and the [list of available interfaces](/reference/interfaces).
    * `desktop` (string)
       Path to the desktop file, see [Commands, daemons & assets](/build-snaps/metadata#fixed-assets) for details.  
    * `daemon` (string)
      If present, integrates the runnable as a system service. Valid values are
      `forking`, `oneshot`, `notify` and `simple`.

      If set to `simple`, it is expected that the command configured is the main
      process.

      If set to `oneshot`, it is expected that the command configured
      will exit once it's done (won't be a long-lasting process).

      If set to `forking`, it is expected that the configured command will call
      fork() as part of its start-up. The parent process is expected to exit
      when start-up is complete and all communication channels are set up. The child continues to run as the main daemon process. This is the
      behavior of traditional UNIX daemons.

      If set to `notify`, it is expected that the command configured will send a signal to systemd to indicate that it's running.
    * `stop-command` (string)
      Requires `daemon` to be specified and represents the command to run to
      stop the service.
    * `stop-timeout` (string)
      Requires `daemon` to be specified. It is the length of time with unit (`10ns`, `10us`, `10ms`, `10s`, `10m`)
      that the system will wait for the service to stop before terminating it
      via `SIGTERM` (and `SIGKILL` if that doesn't work).
    * `post-stop-command` (string)
      Optional command to run after daemon stops.
    * `restart-condition` (string)
      Condition to restart the daemon under. Valid values are `on-failure`, `on-success`, `on-abnormal`, `on-abort`, `always` and `never`. Defaults to `on-failure`. See the [systemd.service manual](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html#Restart=) on `Restart` for details.
    * `listen-stream` (string)
      Optional stream abstract socket name or socket path. Valid formats are: `<path>`, `@<snap name>` or `@<snap name>_<suffix>`. When defined as a path, it should normally be in one of the snap [writable directories](/reference/confinement). For an abstract socket it must start with `@<snap name>` or `@<snap name>_`.
    * `socket` (bool)
      Whether the daemon is socket activated. Defaults to `false`, and must be defined together with `listen-stream` if `true`.

### Parts

Parts are the main building blocks of snaps: source code, packages, tarballs or organizational steps that are used to create your snap content. Check out the
[parts section](/build-snaps/parts) for concrete examples.

* `parts` (yaml subsection)
  A map of part names to their own part configuration. Order in the file is
  not relevant (to aid copy-and-pasting).
    * `plugin` (string)
      Specifies the plugin name that will manage this part. Snapcraft will pass
      to it all the other user-specified part options. If plugin is not
      defined, [the wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Snappy/Parts) will be
      searched for the part, the local values defined in the part will be used
      to compose the final part.
    * `after` (list of strings)
      Specifies any parts that should be built before this part is. This is
      mostly useful when a part needs a library or build tool built by another
      part. If the part defined in after is not defined locally, the part will
      be searched for in [the wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Snappy/Parts).
      *If a part is supposed to run after another, the prerequisite part will
      be staged before the dependent part starts its lifecycle.*
    * `stage-packages` (list of strings and/or sublists)
      A set of Ubuntu packages to be downloaded and unpacked to join the part
      before it's built. Note that these packages are not installed on the host.
      Like the rest of the part, all files from these packages will make it into
      the final snap unless filtered out via the `prime` keyword.

      One may simply specify packages in a flat list, in which case the packages
      will be fetched and unpacked regardless of build environment. In addition,
      a specific grammar made up of sub-lists is supported here that allows one
      to filter stage packages depending on various selectors (e.g. the target
      arch), as well as specify optional packages. The grammar is made up of two
      nestable statements: 'on' and 'try'.

          - on <selector>[,<selector>...]:
            - ...
          - else[ fail]:
            - ...

      The body of the 'on' clause is taken into account if every (AND, not OR)
      selector is true for the target build environment. Currently the only
      selectors supported are target architectures (e.g. amd64).

      If the 'on' clause doesn't match and it's immediately followed by an
      'else' clause, the 'else' clause must be satisfied. An 'on' clause without
      an 'else' clause is considered satisfied even if no selector matched. The
      'else fail' form allows erroring out if an 'on' clause was not matched.

      For example, to fetch the `hello` package only when building on amd64:

          - on amd64:
            - hello

      To fetch something else on other architectures:

          - on amd64:
            - hello
          - else:
            - something-else

       You could also use `else fail` instead to cause the build to fail on
       architectures other than amd64.

          - try:
            - ...
          - else:
            - ...

      The body of the 'try' clause is taken into account only when all packages
      contained within it are valid (i.e. available in the archive for the given
      architecture). If not, if it's immediately followed by 'else' clauses they
      are tried in order, and one of them must be satisfied. A 'try' clause with
      no 'else' clause is considered satisfied even if it contains invalid
      packages.

      For example, let's say a stage-package isn't available for all
      architectures. You could make it an optional stage-package like so:

          - try:
            - my-optional-package

      This would cause `my-optional-package` to be staged only when it's
      available in the archive for the architecture being built. You could also
      provide alternatives:

          - try:
            - my-optional-package
          - else
            - try-this-one

    * `build-packages` (list of strings)
      A list of Ubuntu packages to be installed on the host to aid in building
      the part. These packages will not go into the final snap.
    * `filesets` (yaml subsection)
      A dictionary with filesets, the key being a recognizable user defined
      string and its value a list of strings of files to be included or
      excluded. Globbing is achieved with `*` for either inclusions or
      exclusion. Exclusions are denoted by a `-`. Globbing is computed from
      the private sections of the part.
    * `organize` (yaml subsection)
      A dictionary exposing replacements, the key is the internal name whilst
      the value the exposed name, filesets will refer to the exposed named
      applied after organization is applied.
    * `stage` (list of strings)
      A list of files from a part's installation to expose in stage. Rules
      applying to the list here are the same as those of filesets. Referencing
      of fileset keys is done with a $ prefixing the fileset key, which will
      expand with the value of such key.
    * `prime` (list of strings)
      A list of files from a part's installation to expose in the snap. Rules
      applying to the list here are the same as those of filesets. Referencing
      of fileset keys is done with a `$` prefixing the fileset key, which will
      expand with the value of such key.

    * `build-attributes` (list of strings)
      A list of special attributes that affect the build of this specific part. Supported attributes:

        * `no-system-libraries`: Do not automatically copy required libraries from the system to satisfy the dependencies of this part. This might be useful if one knows these dependencies will be satisfied in other manner, e.g. via content sharing from other snaps.

The `snapcraft.yaml` in any project is validated to be compliant to these
keywords, if there is any missing expected component or invalid value,
`snapcraft` will exit with an error.
