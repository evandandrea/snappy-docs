title: Directory structure
---

This section describes the directories found within a snap and details their content.

If you're building your snaps with [snapcraft](/build-snaps), after running a build, the directory structure can be seen in the `prime/` directory.

Directory | Purpose | Content
:---- | ---- | ----
`/` | Where your code is shipped, along wrapper files generated by Snapcraft. | App source code, `*.wrapper` files
`/bin` | Contains all binaries shipped by the app. | Binaries
`/meta` | Contains details that describe the snap. | [`snap.yaml`](/snaps/metadata), licence.txt
`/meta/gui` | Contains GUI related files for the snap. | Desktop files, icons

## Installed snaps

Snaps are installed in the `/snap/<snap>` directory.

In each `<snap>` directory, the three most recent revisions of a snap are kept, with `current` symlinked to the active one.
